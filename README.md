What is this?
----------

This is a collection of various math problems that I try and visualise / solve with python.

I try to make a practise out of doing this, as it not only helps my coding skills but also
my mathematical reasoning. Some solutions are partially complete but still functional, as
I coded it to a point that I understood it fully.
